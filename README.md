### Sealed-Bid Auctions: 
#### Auction which takes place by allowing bidders to submit their own bid in a sealed envelope. The auctioneer calls for who gets the good, as well as the price of the good. 

### The idea is to facilitate a transaction which gives the good to the person who values it the most.


#### Vickrey Auction Method:
Also known as second price auction. It is precisely what it sounds like, everyone bid their bid on the good, the winner pays the second highest bid instead of their own bid.

This method allow the bidders to bid their true value on the good without much reasoning as this is the dominant strategy.
