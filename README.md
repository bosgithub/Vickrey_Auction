### First, what is sealed-bid auctions?

*__Sealed bid auctions__* are auctions which take place by allowing bidders to submit their own bid in a sealed envelope. The auctioneer calls for who gets the good, as well as the price of the good. This is much like the canadian real estate market, where the buyer bids on the price of a property and the seller decide if it is good.

#### The idea is we want to facilitate a transaction on the good to the person who values it the most.

### Now, let's talk about Vickrey Auction Method:
Also known as second price auction. It is precisely what it sounds like, everyone bid their bid on the good, the winner pays the second highest bid instead of their own bid.

This method allow the bidders to bid their true value on the good without much reasoning as this is the dominant strategy which can provide them with highest value.

_here is an example:_

say, we have a condo for sell, we know the neighbours who recently sold similar properties for around 750k, we let this be the private valuation of our condo. We allow people to bid via the method of Vickrey Auction.


| Bidders       | Price         | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| John          | 700k          | 
| Lisa          | 760k          | 
| Cindy         | 800k          |  
| Max           | 740k          |  


4 bidders, we see John, Lisa, Max all lost, they didn't win the property and they didn't pay anything.

Cindy with an offer of 800k wins this auction, but because we are in a Vickrey auction, she pays the second highest bid, which is 760k, what Lisa bid. Saving her 40k from her true value of 800k, us as the seller is willing to sell for 750k but because of this method, we can get extra 10k, everyone is happy.
