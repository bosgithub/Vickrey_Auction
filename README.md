### First, what is sealed-bid auctions?
#### Sealed bid auctions are auctions which take place by allowing bidders to submit their own bid in a sealed envelope. The auctioneer calls for who gets the good, as well as the price of the good. This is much like the canadian real estate market, where the buyer bid on the price of a property and seller decide if it is good.

#### The idea is we want to facilitate a transaction on the good to the person who values it the most.


### Now, let's talk about Vickrey Auction Method:
Also known as second price auction. It is precisely what it sounds like, everyone bid their bid on the good, the winner pays the second highest bid instead of their own bid.

This method allow the bidders to bid their true value on the good without much reasoning as this is the dominant strategy. 

_here is an example:_

say, we have a condo for sell, we know the neighbours who also have similar properties recently sold theirs for around 750k. We allow people to bid via the method of Vickrey Auction.
